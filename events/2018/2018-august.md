## Talks

My name is **Ed Toro**. I taught at [Wyncode Academy](https://wyncode.co/) in Miami, FL for 4 years before moving to Atlanta about 2 months ago.

### Intro to Ruby

#### What is Ruby?

Ruby is a [Turing complete](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/Turing_Paper_1936.pdf) programming language.

Programming langauges have [traditionally been written to take it easy on the machine](http://www.hexblog.com/?p=17).

Ruby was written to to make programming easier on humans. ["Ruby is designed to make programmers happy."](https://www.artima.com/intv/rubyP.html)

Why is programmer happiness important?

Imagine a programming langauge spectrum.

At one end, [zeroes and ones](http://www.hexblog.com/?p=17) - hard for a human to understand what's going on, but easy for computers.

At the other end, high-level langauges like [Ruby](http://helloworldcollection.de/#Ruby) and [Python](http://helloworldcollection.de/#Python%C2%A03) - easy for humans to understand, but hard for computers.

Why do we have high-level languages?

Because [computers get twice as fast every two years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law), but humans don't get twice as smart.

The things we did to [bend over backwards for computers](http://ascienceenthusiast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/evolution.jpg) half-a-centry ago don't make sense today. Instead of adapting to our tools, our tools should be adapting to us.

Ruby [first appeared in 1995](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)), the same [year Java was released](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)). It was created by Japanese computer scientist [Yukihiro Matsumoto (aka Matz)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukihiro_Matsumoto).

Matz is very polite, so the Ruby community has a motto:
_MINASWAN_: "Matz is nice and so we are nice,"

Ruby is
- An easy-to-use scripting language.
- A well-designed programming language. It's like the Apple of programming languages.
- Designed to make programmers happy.

> Often people, especially computer engineers, focus on the machines. They think, â€˜By doing this, the machine will run faster. By doing this, the machine will run more effectively. By doing this, the machine will something something something.â€™ They are focusing on machines. But in fact we need to focus on humans, on how humans care about doing programming or operating the application of the machines.

Ruby has a strong fanbase. Even people who have moved on to other languages look back fondly upon their time with Ruby.

#### Ruby Syntax

Practice at [REPL.it/languages/ruby](https://repl.it/languages/ruby)

What's the difference?
```ruby
# no newlines
print "Hello", "world"

# free newlines
puts "Hello", "world"
```

Math:
```ruby
1+1
1 - 1 # whitespace is optional
2*2
4/2
```

Floating point math:
```ruby
1/3
5/2

# Use floats if you want the answer to be a float.
1.0/3.0

# On either side
5.0/2
5/2.0
```

[Learn more about floating point arithmetic across different languages.](http://0.30000000000000004.com/)
```ruby
0.1 + 0.2
```

Ruby is an object-oriented langauge.
`object.method(argument, argument, ...)`
In OO-language syntax, the object typically comes first.

The object in OOP is like the subject of the sentence.

_The quick fox jumped over the lazy dog._
Translated into OOP syntax is.
`the_quick_fox.jumped_over(the_lazy_dog)`

_Run Forrest!_ becomes `forrest.run!`

Ruby has standard (canonical) and idiomatic syntaxes:
```rb
1+1    # idiomatic
1.+(1) # standard, but weird looking
```
Ruby converts the idiomatic into the standard. There is always a standard equivalent to every line of Ruby, even if it looks weird.

If the object is missing, it's _implied_ (like the JavaScript `window` object).

Sometimes the implied object is `Kernel`
```rb
puts "hello"         # idiomatic
Kernel.puts("Hello") # standard
```

Mostly the implied object is `self`:
```rb
to_s
self.to_s
```

Ruby has a large _standard library_.
```rb
methods
```

The stdlib is broken up into _modules_.
```rb
Kernel.methods
Math.methods
```

Parentheses and semicolons are optional. This syntax takes the most getting-used-to.
```rb
puts("Hello world");
puts "Hello world"
```
For example `methods` is a _method_ that returns a list of methods.
```rb
methods();
methods
```

To make Ruby more English-language-friendly, Matz noticed that the English language doesn't use (parens) and sem;colons very often, so he designed a language that would look similar. Ruby programs can sometimes look like minimalist poetry.

#### Ruby Data Types

Ruby understands numbers.
```rb
1
1.5
-1
```

Ruby can introspect. You can ask it what something is.
```rb
1.class
-1.class
1.5.class
(1.5).class # parens aren't required, but it makes this clearer
```

And you can ask it what something can do.
```rb
1.methods
```

Use introspection + Google to learn more about the language.

##### Numbers

```rb
1.even?
1.odd?
0.zero?
```

Ruby doesn't care that these methods end with a `?`. But, by convention, methods that end with `?` typically return `true` or `false` (like the answer to a yes/no question).

Rounding a number converts a `Float` into an `Integer`.
```rb
1.5.round
1.5.truncate
1.5.round.class
```

Comparison
```rb
0 < 1
0 <= 1
1 > 0
1 >= 0
0 == 0  # 2 ='s are good enough, 3 is overkill
1 <=> 1 # "spaceship" operator
```
The spaceship operator returns -1, 0, or 1 for less-than, equal-to, or greater-than.

##### Strings

```rb
"hello world"
'hello world'
"hello".class
"hello".methods
```

Some String methods.
```rb
"hello".upcase
"hello".downcase
"hello".capitalize
"hello".length
"a" < "b"
"hello" + " world"
```

Be careful with data types.
```rb
1 + 1
"1" + "1"
```

Convert your data types.
```rb
"1".to_i + "1".to_i
```
Ruby uses the `to_*` convention to indicate methods that change the data type.

Ruby is Unicode-aware.
```rb
puts "ðŸ’©"
```

Ruby uses standard escape characters:
```rb
puts "Hello\"World"
puts 'Hello\'World'
puts 'Hello\\World'
```

`'string'` and `"string"` are slightly different
```rb
puts "Hello\nWorld"
puts 'Hello\nWorld'
```

##### Booleans

```rb
true
false
```

##### Nil

```rb
nil
"hello".nil?
nil.nil?
1 <=> "1"
```
The "spaceship" operator has 4 possible outputs: `-1`, `0`, `1`, and `nil` (not comparable).

##### Array

```rb
[1,2,3]
[1, 2, 3]
["hello", "world"]
```

Can contain mixed types.
```rb
[1, 1.5, "a", true, nil]
```

##### Hash

```rb
{ "a" => 1, "b" => 2 }
```

Ruby also has a JS-like Hash syntax.
```rb
{a: 1, b: 2}
```

But these two Hashes are not the same.
